## Tealium React Native

This repository contains the necessary assets for exposing Tealium's native [Android](https://docs.tealium.com/platforms/android-kotlin/) and [iOS](https://docs.tealium.com/platforms/ios-swift/) mobile libraries to the JavaScript code in your React Native project. This includes code for exposing the native APIs for both platforms through React Native's bridging system, and a basic helper class in JavaScript to create a single cross platform API.

You can also find a example application demonstrating how everything is put together and how the API gets called in JavaScript.
